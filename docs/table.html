      <td>`extends`</td>
      <td>`string|string[]`</td>
      <td>
        Either a string or an array of strings. Each string allows you to specify an internally
        curated list of rules (we suggest `recommended` here).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`pending`</td>
      <td>`string[]`</td>
      <td>
        An array of module id&#39;s that are still pending. The goal of this array is to allow
        incorporating template linting into an existing project without changing every single
        template file. You can add all existing templates to this `pending` listing and slowly work
        through them while at the same time ensuring that new templates added to the project pass
        all defined rules. You can generate this list with the: `ember-template-lint *
        --print-pending`.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>`ignore`</td>
      <td>`string[]|glob[]`</td>
      <td>
        An array of module id&#39;s that are to be completely ignored. See [ignore
        documentation](docs/ignore.md) for more details.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`plugins`</td>
      <td>`(string|Object)[]`</td>
      <td>
        An array of plugin objects or strings that resolve to files that export plugin objects. See
        [plugin documentation](docs/plugins.md) for more details.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`overrides`</td>
      <td>`Array`</td>
      <td>
        An array of overrides that would allow overriding of specific rules for user specified
        files/folders. See [overrides documentation](docs/overrides.md) for more details.
